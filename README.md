# Kyohei Okawa | Unity Engineer

Unity specialized developer exploring the world of Rust and C++ game frameworks.

- Unity is my main tool, but I'm currently fascinated by [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) and [Axmol](https://github.com/axmolengine/axmol).
- Learning Rust through game development.
- Recently launched [BigRiverLab](https://www.bigriverlab.com/), a blog where you can play games directly in the browser, built with [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola).

### Beyond Coding
I'm a big fan of Onsen (Japanese Hot Springs). I love staying at various Onsen Ryokans—I make it a point to go about once a month to recharge and relax.
